In this file there will be commands to write in virtual server for hosting a website 

Step 1 - Open Terminal , Now we have to SSH into the instance  for that we go to instance and click on instance connect for hosting the website .
After cliccking it will give us many options to connect but in this file i will show how to do it with SSH client .Copy example from SSL client and 
paste it in the local device terminal to connect with ec2 instance 

After pasting and clicking on enter the terminal asks if you want to continue or not type on yes 

Type on "ls" in temrinal and select where the key pair is downloaded and open it . Then EC2 instance runs in our local device 
Type "sudo su" (for gaining root access)
Type "sudo yum update"(to check if your using latest yum or not)
type Yes for conformation 

Install Apache now 

Type in "sudo yum install httpd -y "

Now Apache is installed in EC2 Instance 

For starting Apache 
Go back to terminal 

type in "systemt1 start httpd"
type in "system enable httpd"
Now Apache is running 

For checking the status of Apache we type in "systemt1 status httpd"  if it is green then we are good to go 

Now lets go into the website directory using command "cd and directory of website with it "

For getting the file we use the uploaded object in S3 as shown in "Steps to Host a website"

Go to S3 and copy object URL
In terminal we type wget and paste the URl beside it 

Now the file is downloaded in EC2 to check type ls 

We have to unzip the file 

For that we type unzip and type in the name of wensite downloaded 

Now the folder is unziped 

Now type in command mv Folder name and click on enter 

Now we have to start hhtpd by clicking on command systemt1 start httpd 

Now the website is  running in the above URl of the object 

So that how e host a wesite using S3 and EC2 instance
