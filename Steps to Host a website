Step 1 - Open S3 bucket and create a new S3 bucket . Then open public acess as we host it to customers .Then make sure to disable server-side-encryption 
Then click on create bucket and then after creating bucket check in dashboard if the bucket shows access is object can be public 

Step 2 - In this step we upload the zip file of the website .

Step 3 - Now we have to remember that objects can be public but is not public so we have to change the bucket policy for this object to be public .For that
we go into the S3 bucket created then we click on permisiions and scroling down we click on edit bucket policy ,we can either manually change it or we can 
use policy genarater.If clickin on policy generater we select S3 Bucket Policy for selecting type of policy , principal will be "*" action will be "GetObject",
add bucket name  as the ARN Then we click on Add Statement and genrate a policy .Policy generator will do the work and it will give a policy where we copy 
paste it in in the bucket policy Now the object is public 

Step 4 - Work with EC2 instance I will give the commands in another file called " EC2 Instance configaration for hosting a website "
